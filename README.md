<h3>
Write a web page using node server, where there is a single text window. The text window can only be added to, not edited except for taking new text from the user. Have a single button named add_text that the user can click in order to be the only one at the moment that can add text to the text window so that multiple users do not edit at the same time, but allow all users to add text to the window. Whatever text the window has at any time will be preserved on the server so that the changes persist regardless of what users are connected to the web page. To indicate when text can be added, have the window change color, or if another user is already editing (adding text) then tell the first user another user is already editing. Do not worry too much about asynchronous changes, it is ok if some changes get mixed with other users
